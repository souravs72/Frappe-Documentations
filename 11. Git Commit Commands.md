### ✅ Tips for Writing Good Git Commit Messages

1. Use **imperative mood**: "Add feature" instead of "Added feature".
2. Keep the **summary short** (50-72 characters).
3. Explain **why**, not just what, in the optional body.
4. Use a **prefix (type)** for clarity: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, etc.
5. Keep commit messages **consistent** across the team.

---

**Example Workflow:**

```
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: clean up generate_recurring_task_instances function"
git push origin main
```

This guide ensures that your Git history is **clean, readable, and easy to navigate**.
